# DH140-Final-Project
Repository for my final Project for Digital Humanities 140 for Winter 2023.  

This project is in its initial stages and this readme currently presents ideas for potential projects.

---
## Potential Topics
### Humanities Topics I find Interesting:
* pop culture
* languages

### Most Interesting from Class Schedule:
*Getting Data: Web Scraping and API* seems like it will be the most interesting topic since I am generally more interested in the tools to get and manipulate data than I am in the data itself.

### Quick Search for Related Datasets/Articles:
